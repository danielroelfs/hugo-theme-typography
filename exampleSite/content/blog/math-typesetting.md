Mathematical notation is activated by default in the _typography_ theme.

The integration is provided using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). Here's some inline math: $y = ax^2+bx+c$.

### Examples

$$\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887\dots$$

And another one for good measure

$$
\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots}}}
$$
