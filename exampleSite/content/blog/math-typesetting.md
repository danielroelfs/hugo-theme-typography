Mathematical notation is activated by default in the _typography_ theme.

The integration is provided using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). In-line math typesetting isn't quite in place yet, but it's work in progress.

### Examples

$$\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887\dots$$

And another one for good measure

$$
\varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots}}}
$$
