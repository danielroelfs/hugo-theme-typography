To get in touch with me, you can visit [my website](https://danielroelfs.com) for all the links you need to get in touch. If you encounter any problems or bugs on this website, you can [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#) on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danielroelfs/hugo-theme-typography).

Btw, you'll notice that this page is not shown in the navigation bar on the bottom. You can hide pages you wish to include in your website but not show in the navigation menu by setting the `identifier` parameter for the menu item to `"hide-from-nav"`. This may help reduce clutter in the navigation menu.
