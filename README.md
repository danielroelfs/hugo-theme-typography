## Quick start

To get started with Hugo, please consult the [installation instructions for Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). The next steps assume that you have Hugo installed and that you have a directory with a basic Hugo site, for example the framework generated by running:

```sh
hugo new site .
```

This starts a fresh Hugo site in your current directory.

### Step 1. Get the theme

#### Method 1: clone the repository to your Hugo site

While in the root directory of your Hugo site, download this theme by cloning this repository into the `themes/` folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danielroelfs/hugo-theme-typography themes/typography
```

If you choose this method, you can update the theme using the following commands:

```sh
cd themes/typography
git pull
```

#### Method 2: install this theme as a submodule

If you're maintaining your Hugo site with Git, it may be worthwhile to install this theme as a submodule in your repository. This would make it easier to keep the theme up to date.

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/danielroelfs/hugo-theme-typography.git themes/typography
```

Updating the theme if you chose this method, run:

```sh
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

### Step 2. Preview the theme

The theme comes with a sample site that shows some of the functionality. This is the same site that is used for the [online demo](https://danielroelfs.github.io/hugo-theme-typography). To preview this website locally, you can run the following command from the root directory of your Hugo site:

```sh
cd themes/typography/exampleSite/
hugo serve --themesDir ../.. --theme typography
```

Then in a browser open `http://localhost:1313/` to view the site. The `exampleSite` also contains some sample content you can use while developing your Hugo site.

### Step 3. Update the `config.toml`

Update the `config.toml` (or `hugo.toml` depending on your Hugo version) by adding or replacing the following line as such:

```sh
theme: "typography"
```

### Step 4. Add content

Now it's your turn! You can create new content by using one of templates included in this theme. You can create a new post either by creating a new Markdown document in the desired path or by running:

```sh
hugo new <path>/<filename>.md
```

You can experiment using the following settings in the frontmatter of your pages by editing some of the fields. For example, you can hide the date in the sidebar for each post by adding `showdate = false` to the frontmatter. To show the author of the post, you can add `author = "John Doe"` and so on.

### Step 5. Make other changes

See the `config.toml` file in the `exampleSite` for further inspiration how to edit your config file. You can add, remove, or change the home menu items, and hide pages from the navigation bar in the bottom. For the rest, generally default Hugo configations are available here as well.

## Preview the site

To preview the site run `hugo serve` or `hugo serve -t typography` and open `http://localhost:1313/` in a webbrowser.
