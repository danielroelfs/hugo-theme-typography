# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing! The community is really the most valuable part of any project, and your input is greatly appreciated.

## Open an Issue

If you encounter an issue, a bug, feel like something is missing from the theme, or just want to ask a question, please open an issue and we can discuss there. Please provide any helpful information that can help to implement the feature request or bugfix.

## Create a Pull Request

If you would like to change or fix something yourself, you can always create a pull request (PR)! It may be most helpful to open an issue before you create the PR so me and others know what you're working on. Please refer to the issue number in your branch name so it's easy to keep track of what belongs with what.

I think the best practice would be make sure your fork is [synced with `main`](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork), before you [create a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). It may be most helpful to [allow changes to a pull request by the maintainers](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) for help with minor changes.
